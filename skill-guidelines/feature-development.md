# Feature Development - Complete Skill Suite

Consolidated setup guide for all feature-related skills: orchestration, requirements definition, development planning, and implementation.

---

## Overview

The **Feature Development Suite** provides a complete workflow from feature idea to tested implementation. This guide contains setup instructions for all related skills in one place.

### Skills in This Suite

| Skill | Purpose | Type |
|-------|---------|------|
| `feature-workflow` | End-to-end orchestration from idea to code | Orchestrator |
| `feature-define` | Create PRD from feature ideas | Atomic |

## Phase 0: Repository Detection

Follow the standard repository detection process to understand your project structure.

### Reference: setup-guidelines/repo-detection.md

The repository detection process helps customize skills to your project. Key steps:

1. **Detect Spec Directory** - Where PRDs and plans are stored
2. **Detect Tool Configuration** - AI tool's config directory
3. **Read Project Conventions** - Naming, approval processes, testing
4. **Check Existing Artifacts** - Review existing PRDs/plans for format
5. **Analyze Codebase Structure** - Understand code organization

### Feature Suite Specific Checks

```bash
# Find spec directory
for dir in specs dev-docs docs/planning .docs planning docs/prd; do
  if [ -d "$dir" ]; then
    echo "Found spec directory: $dir"
    SPEC_DIR="$dir"
    break
  fi
done

# Find existing PRDs and plans
find ${SPEC_DIR} -name "*-prd.md" -o -name "prd-*.md" 2>/dev/null
find ${SPEC_DIR} -name "*-plan.md" -o -name "plan-*.md" 2>/dev/null

# Check for test framework
ls -la tests/ test/ __tests__/ 2>/dev/null

# Review project conventions
cat CLAUDE.md README.md CONTRIBUTING.md 2>/dev/null
```

### Detection Summary Template

```markdown
## Feature Suite Detection Summary

- **Spec directory**: ${SPEC_DIR}
- **Tool config**: ${TOOL_CONFIG}
- **Document naming pattern**: [e.g., YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-prd.md]
- **Project type**: [language/framework]
- **Test location**: [detected test directory]
- **Test framework**: [e.g., pytest, jest, cargo test]
- **Existing PRDs**: [count]
- **Existing plans**: [count]
- **Key conventions**: [summary]
```

**Gate:** Do not proceed until spec directory and tool config are identified.

---

## Phase 1: Prerequisites

Follow the standard prerequisites validation to ensure all required directories and access exist.

### Reference: setup-guidelines/prerequisites.md

Standard validation steps:

1. **Verify Spec Directory Exists** - Create if needed
2. **Verify Tool Skills Directory Exists** - Create base structure
3. **Test File Access** - Ensure read/write permissions
4. **Verify Project Documentation Access** - Can read conventions
5. **Identify Skill Consumers** - Who/what uses these skills

### Feature Suite Specific Prerequisites

```bash
# Create spec directory if needed
mkdir -p ${SPEC_DIR}

# Create skill directories
mkdir -p ${TOOL_CONFIG}/skills/feature-workflow
mkdir -p ${TOOL_CONFIG}/skills/feature-define
mkdir -p ${TOOL_CONFIG}/skills/feature-define-review
mkdir -p ${TOOL_CONFIG}/skills/feature-plan

---

## Phase 2: Skill Definitions

Complete SKILL.md templates for all skills in the feature development suite.

---

## Skill 1: feature-workflow

**Purpose:** End-to-end feature development orchestrator with state detection and review gates.

**File:** `${TOOL_CONFIG}/skills/feature-workflow/SKILL.md`

```markdown

name: feature-workflow
description: End-to-end feature development workflow with state detection and review gates
disable-model-invocation: true
---

# Feature Workflow

Complete feature development orchestrator from requirements to implementation.

## Phase 0: Detect Current State

**Check what already exists:**

### Look for PRD
Search for existing requirements documents:
- Check ${SPEC_DIR} for *-prd.md files
- If found: Read it and skip to Phase 3 (Plan Implementation)

### Look for Plan
Search for existing development plans:
- Check ${SPEC_DIR} for *-plan.md files
- If found: Read it and skip to Phase 5 (Decide Execution)

### Look for Partial Implementation
Check if code mentioned in plan exists:
- If partial: Resume from where work stopped

**Output:** Starting phase for this workflow

---

## Phase 1: Define Requirements

**Only execute if no PRD exists.**

Create the Product Requirements Document:
```
/feature-define
```

**Output:** PRD file in ${SPEC_DIR}/

---

## Phase 2: Review Requirements

**User Review Gate**

Present the PRD to the user:
1. Read the generated PRD
2. Summarize key requirements
3. Ask: "Does this PRD capture the requirements correctly?"

**If changes requested:** Update and return to this phase
**If approved:** Proceed to Phase 3

---

## Phase 3: Plan Implementation

**Only execute if no plan exists.**

Create the development plan from PRD:
```
/feature-plan <prd-file>
```

**Output:** Plan file in ${SPEC_DIR}/

---

## Phase 4: Review Plan

**User Review Gate**

Present the plan:
1. Summarize task breakdown
2. Show dependencies
3. Explain test strategy
4. Ask: "Does this plan look good?"

**If changes requested:** Update and return to this phase
**If approved:** Proceed to Phase 5

---

## Phase 5: Decide Execution Strategy

**Analyze the plan to determine execution approach.**

Check for parallelization opportunities:
- Can tasks be done independently?
- Are there multiple tasks with no dependencies?
- Are tasks cleanly separated?

**If yes → Parallel execution:**
```
/parallel-orchestrate plan <plan-file>
```
Stop here - parallel execution happens in separate sessions.

**If no → Sequential execution:**
Proceed to Phase 6

---

## Phase 6: Propose Implementation

**Design the implementation approach WITHOUT writing code.**

Present to user:
1. **File structure** - What files will be created/modified
2. **Module dependencies** - Import structure
3. **Key functions** - Function signatures (no implementation)
4. **Test strategy** - What tests will verify behavior

**Output:** Implementation proposal for user review

---

## Phase 7: Review Proposal

**User Review Gate**

Ask:
- "Does this implementation approach make sense?"
- "Any concerns about modularity or architecture?"
- "Should I proceed with implementation?"

**If changes requested:** Revise and return to Phase 6
**If approved:** Proceed to Phase 8

---

## Phase 8: Implement

**Execute the implementation:**

```
/feature-impl <plan-file>
```

Follow TDD implementation process:
1. Research existing code
2. Design structure
3. Write tests first
4. Implement feature
5. Run tests
6. Document

**Output:** Implemented feature with passing tests

---

## Phase 9: Review Modularity

**Evaluate code quality against modularity criteria.**

### Cohesion Check
- Does each module have a single, clear purpose?
- Is related functionality grouped together?

### Coherence Check
- Do module boundaries make sense?
- Is the purpose of each file/class clear?

### Coupling Check
- Are dependencies minimal?
- Can modules be tested independently?
- Are interfaces clean and simple?

**Present findings:**
```
Modularity Assessment:
✓/✗ Cohesion: [explanation]
✓/✗ Coherence: [explanation]
✓/✗ Loose Coupling: [explanation]

Recommendations:
- [any refactoring suggestions]
```

**If modularity issues found:** Ask if user wants to refactor

**Output:** Feature complete with modularity verified

---

## Notes

- This skill orchestrates other skills - it does NOT implement functionality directly
- State detection allows resuming from any phase
- Review gates ensure user alignment before proceeding
- Can switch to parallel execution when appropriate
```

---

## Skill 2: feature-define

**Purpose:** Create lightweight, confirmable PRD from feature ideas with user stories and OKRs.

**File:** `${TOOL_CONFIG}/skills/feature-define/SKILL.md`

```markdown
---
name: feature-define
description: Create lightweight, confirmable PRD from feature ideas with user stories and OKRs
disable-model-invocation: true
argument-hint: "[feature idea or description]"
---

# Feature Define

Create a lightweight Product Requirements Document from a feature idea.

## When to Use

Use when:
- Starting a new feature
- Documenting user requirements
- Creating input for development planning

Do NOT use when:
- Writing technical design (use feature-plan)
- PRD already exists

## Input

- Feature idea (text or file path)
- Optional: UI designs, mockups
- Optional: User feedback or business drivers

## Output

PRD at `${SPEC_DIR}/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-prd.md` containing:
- Background and motivation
- Prioritized user stories
- Outcome-oriented OKRs
- UI/interface design
- Non-technical risks
- Scope boundaries

## Process

### Phase 0: Intake

**Purpose:** Capture the initial feature idea and supporting materials.

1. **Capture Feature Idea**
   - If argument is text, capture it
   - If argument is file path, read it
   - If no argument, ask user to describe

2. **Check for UI Designs**
   - Mockups (Figma, Sketch, images)
   - Wireframes
   - Screenshots to reference

3. **Gather Context**
   - Related features
   - User feedback driving this
   - Business goals

**Gate:** User confirms this captures the idea correctly.

---

### Phase 1: Background and Context

**Purpose:** Establish why this feature matters.

Write background answering:
- What problem does this solve?
- Who experiences this problem?
- Why is solving it important now?
- What's the current workaround?

Keep to 3-5 paragraphs maximum.

**Gate:** User approves background.

---

### Phase 2: User Stories

**Purpose:** Define who needs what and why.

1. **Identify Personas**
   - Primary users (main beneficiaries)
   - Secondary users
   - Admin/operator roles

2. **Write Stories**
   Format: **As a [persona], I want [capability], so that [benefit]**

   Good characteristics:
   - Specific persona (not "user")
   - Clear capability (one thing)
   - Tangible benefit (outcome, not feature)
   - Independent

3. **Prioritize**
   - **Must Have** - Core value
   - **Should Have** - Important but not critical
   - **Nice to Have** - Can defer

**Gate:** User approves user stories.

---

### Phase 3: OKRs (Success Criteria)

**Purpose:** Define outcome-oriented success criteria.

1. **Write Objective**
   One clear statement: "Enable [aspirational goal]"

2. **Write Key Results**
   3-5 measurable outcomes:
   - KR1: [What will be true when done]
   - KR2: [Measurable capability]
   - KR3: [Performance target]

   Good KRs are:
   - Outcome-oriented (what exists, not what we build)
   - High-level (system capabilities)
   - Measurable (can verify objectively)

   Avoid:
   - "Implement X" (implementation detail)
   - "Add settings page" (feature, not outcome)
   - "Write tests" (process, not outcome)

3. **Map to User Stories**
   Verify each "Must Have" story maps to at least one KR.

**Gate:** User approves OKRs.

---

### Phase 4: UI Designs

**Purpose:** Capture or describe the user interface.

If UI mockups provided:
- Include links or embed images
- Extract key UI elements
- Note interactions/flows

If no designs, describe:
- Component type (button/form/dashboard)
- Location in app
- Elements and interactions
- States (default, loading, error, success)

For non-UI features (API/backend):
- Entry points
- Data formats

**Gate:** User approves UI description.

---

### Phase 5: Non-Technical Risks

**Purpose:** Identify business, user, and operational risks.

Categories:
- **User Risks:** Adoption, confusion, workflow disruption
- **Business Risks:** Revenue, compliance, reputation
- **Operational Risks:** Support burden, maintenance
- **Timeline Risks:** Dependencies, unknowns

For each risk:
- Description
- Likelihood (Low/Medium/High)
- Impact (Low/Medium/High)
- Mitigation strategy

**Gate:** User acknowledges risks.

---

### Phase 6: Scope Boundaries

**Purpose:** Define explicit out-of-scope items.

1. **List What's NOT Included**
   - Features explicitly excluded
   - User types not supported
   - Edge cases deferred
   - Integrations not included

2. **Explain Why**
   Brief rationale for each exclusion.

**Gate:** User confirms scope boundaries.

---

### Phase 7: Write PRD Document

**Purpose:** Compile all sections into formal document.

Create file: `${SPEC_DIR}/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-prd.md`

```markdown
# [Feature Name] PRD

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Draft

## Background
[From Phase 1]

## User Stories
[From Phase 2]

## OKRs
[From Phase 3]

## UI Design
[From Phase 4]

## Non-Technical Risks
[From Phase 5]

## Out of Scope
[From Phase 6]
```

---

### Phase 8: Review and Confirmation

**Purpose:** Get stakeholder sign-off.

Present complete PRD and ask:
- "Does this capture the feature correctly?"
- "Any gaps or concerns?"
- "Ready to approve for planning?"

If changes needed:
- Update relevant sections
- Return to this phase

If approved:
- Update status to "Approved"
- Ready for `/feature-plan`

---

## Best Practices

### User Stories
- Be specific about personas
- One capability per story
- Focus on outcomes, not features
- Keep stories independent

### OKRs
- Outcome-oriented, not implementation
- High-level system capabilities
- Measurable and verifiable
- Map to user stories

### Scope
- Be explicit about exclusions
- Explain rationale
- Prevents scope creep
```

---

## Skill 3: feature-define-review

**Purpose:** Review and validate PRD for completeness and clarity.

**File:** `${TOOL_CONFIG}/skills/feature-define-review/SKILL.md`

## Skill 4: feature-plan

**Purpose:** Transform PRD into comprehensive development plan with task decomposition and system-level OKRs.

**File:** `${TOOL_CONFIG}/skills/feature-plan/SKILL.md`

```markdown
---
name: feature-plan
description: Transform PRD into comprehensive development plan with task decomposition and system OKRs
disable-model-invocation: true
argument-hint: "[path-to-prd or PRD description]"
---

# Feature Plan

Transform a Product Requirements Document into an actionable development plan.

## When to Use

Use when:
- Have an approved PRD
- Need to create technical design
- Breaking work into parallel tasks
- Before implementation begins

Do NOT use when:
- Creating the PRD (use feature-define)
- Already have a development plan
- Implementing (use feature-impl)

## Input

- PRD file path (e.g., `${SPEC_DIR}/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-prd.md`)
- OR PRD description text

## Output

Development plan at `${SPEC_DIR}/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-plan.md` containing:
- Clarified requirements
- Risk assessment
- Design options with recommendation
- Task breakdown with dependencies
- System-level OKRs
- Implementation roadmap

## Process

### Phase 0: Intake and Context

**Purpose:** Understand the PRD and gather project context.

1. **Read the PRD**
   - If argument is file path, read it
   - If argument is text, capture it
   - If no argument, ask user to provide PRD

2. **Gather Project Context**
   - Read project conventions (CLAUDE.md, README.md)
   - Review similar features in codebase
   - Check framework documentation
   - Identify relevant patterns

3. **Initial Understanding Check**
   - Summarize PRD in 2-3 sentences
   - List key requirements
   - Note immediate questions

**Gate:** User confirms understanding is correct.

---

### Phase 1: Question Resolution

**Purpose:** Identify and resolve ambiguities in requirements.

1. **Identify Questions**
   Review PRD for ambiguities in:
   - Scope (in vs. out?)
   - Requirements (must-have vs. nice-to-have?)
   - Behavior (what happens when X?)
   - Integration (how interact with existing?)
   - Constraints (performance? compatibility?)

2. **Check for Better Designs**
   Even if requirements seem clear:
   - Is there a simpler approach?
   - Are there existing patterns to follow?
   - Would a different architecture be better?

3. **Present Questions**
   Group by priority:
   - **Critical** (blocking design)
   - **Important** (affects design options)
   - **Nice to clarify** (minor impact)

4. **Document Answers**
   Update understanding with clarified requirements.

**Gate:** All critical questions answered.

---

### Phase 2: Risk and Complexity Analysis

**Purpose:** Identify technical risks and complexity factors.

1. **Identify Risks**
   - Technical uncertainty (unfamiliar tech?)
   - Integration risk (multiple systems?)
   - Performance risk (scalability?)
   - Complexity risk (complex algorithms?)
   - Dependency risk (third-party?)

2. **Assess Complexity**
   Rate each component:
   - **Simple:** Straightforward, well-understood
   - **Moderate:** Some complexity, patterns exist
   - **Complex:** Novel approach, unknowns

3. **Research Mitigation**
   For each risk:
   - Research solutions
   - Consider prototypes/spikes
   - Identify fallback approaches

**Output:**
```markdown
## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | High | Medium | [Strategy] |

## Complexity
- Component A: Simple
- Component B: Complex - requires new approach
```

**Gate:** User reviews risk assessment.

---

### Phase 3: Structural Design Options

**Purpose:** Propose multiple design options with trade-offs.

1. **Design File Hierarchy**
   For each option, show:
   ```
   Option A: [Name]
   path/to/module.py
     class MainClass
       method_1()
     class HelperClass
   ```

2. **Create Dependency Graphs**
   Show how modules relate:
   ```
   MainClass
     └─> HelperClass
     └─> ExistingClass
   ```

3. **Propose 2-3 Options**
   For each:
   - Approach description
   - File structure
   - Dependencies
   - Trade-offs (pros/cons)

4. **Recommend an Option**
   Clear recommendation with rationale.

**Gate:** User selects or requests refinement.

---

### Phase 4: Task Decomposition

**Purpose:** Break PRD into parallelizable tasks with dependencies.

1. **Identify Task Boundaries**
   Look for tasks that:
   - Can be implemented independently
   - Have clear interfaces
   - Can be tested in isolation

2. **Define Tasks**
   For each task:
   ```markdown
   ### Task: task-name
   **Goal:** [One sentence]
   **Scope:** [What's included]
   **Complexity:** Simple | Moderate | Complex
   ```

3. **Analyze Dependencies**
   For each task:
   - **Depends On:** Which tasks must complete first
   - **Blocks:** Which tasks wait for this one

4. **Create Dependency Graph**
   ```
   Wave 1 (No dependencies):
   ├─ task-data-models
   └─ task-api-spec

   Wave 2 (Depends on Wave 1):
   ├─ task-business-logic
   │  └─ Depends on: task-data-models
   └─ task-ui-views
      └─ Depends on: task-api-spec

   Wave 3:
   └─ task-integration
      └─ Depends on: Wave 2
   ```

5. **Simplify Dependencies**
   - Break long chains
   - Define interfaces to decouple
   - Create foundation tasks

**Gate:** User approves task breakdown.

---

### Phase 5: System-Level OKRs

**Purpose:** Define technical success criteria (complement PRD's product OKRs).

1. **Define Technical Objective**
   One clear objective:
   "Deliver a scalable batch moderation system"

2. **Write System-Level Key Results**
   3-5 technical outcomes:
   - KR1: System processes 1000+ ops/sec with <100ms latency
   - KR2: All components have >80% test coverage
   - KR3: API handles 10x traffic spike
   - KR4: Code follows project conventions

   **Characteristics:**
   - System capabilities, not implementation
   - Performance/quality targets
   - Operational characteristics

3. **Map Tasks to OKRs**
   Show which tasks validate which KRs.

**Gate:** User approves system OKRs.

---

### Phase 6: Detailed Development Plan

**Purpose:** Create implementation roadmap for each task.

1. **Elaborate Each Task**
   ```markdown
   ### Task: task-name

   **Implementation Steps:**
   1. Define base classes
   2. Add validation
   3. Write tests

   **Acceptance Criteria:**
   - All tests pass
   - 80%+ coverage
   - Follows conventions

   **Effort:** Simple | Moderate | Complex
   ```

2. **Define Interfaces**
   Key function signatures and contracts.

3. **Identify Dependencies**
   External libraries, APIs, services needed.

4. **Create Test Strategy**
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Manual testing

**Gate:** User reviews plan.

---

### Phase 7: Write Plan Document

**Purpose:** Save formal document.

Create: `${SPEC_DIR}/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-plan.md`

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Development Plan

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Approved
**PRD:** [link to PRD]

## Overview

# Feature Implementation

Implement a feature from an approved development plan using Test-Driven Development.

## When to Use

Use when:
- Development plan is approved
- Ready to write code
- TDD workflow required

Do NOT use when:
- No plan exists (use feature-plan)
- Parallelizing tasks (use parallel-orchestrate)

## Input

- Path to development plan (e.g., `${SPEC_DIR}/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-plan.md`)

## Output

- Implemented feature with passing tests
- Updated documentation (CLAUDE.md, module READMEs)
- Code following project conventions

## Process

### Phase 0: Read Documentation

**Purpose:** Understand project conventions before starting.

**READ REQUIRED FILES:**
1. Read CLAUDE.md (or equivalent project conventions file)
2. Read relevant module READMEs
3. Review coding standards
4. Note patterns to follow

**CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING:**

## Best Practices

### TDD Workflow
- Always write tests first
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Make tests pass incrementally
- Refactor with confidence

### Documentation Maintenance
- Read conventions in Phase 0
- Follow patterns during implementation
- Update docs in Final Phase
- Prevents drift over time

### Progress Tracking
- Update status after each phase
- Report current task and checklist
- Creates audit trail
- Less likely to skip steps
```

### State Detection Flow

The orchestrator detects existing state and resumes from the appropriate phase:

```
User invokes: /feature-workflow

```

### Skill Composition Patterns

**Sequential Composition** (feature-workflow calls skills in order):
```
feature-workflow
  └─► feature-define
        └─► Produces: ${SPEC_DIR}/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-prd.md
              └─► feature-plan
                    └─► Produces: ${SPEC_DIR}/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-plan.md
                          └─► feature-impl
                                └─► Produces: Working code + tests
```

**Review Integration** (optional structured feedback):
```
feature-define
  └─► PRD created
        └─► User review gate (simple approval)
              └─► OR: /feature-define-review (structured feedback)
                    └─► Detailed checklist + recommendations
```

**Parallel Branching** (orchestrator decides):
```
feature-plan
  └─► Plan with task dependency graph
        └─► feature-workflow analyzes
              │
              ├─► Independent tasks? → /parallel-orchestrate
              │
              └─► Sequential tasks? → /feature-impl
```

### Data Flow

**Artifacts produced at each stage:**

| Phase | Skill | Input | Output |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | feature-define | Feature idea | `*-prd.md` |
| 2 | feature-define-review | `*-prd.md` | Review report |
| 3 | feature-plan | `*-prd.md` | `*-plan.md` |
| 4 | feature-plan-review | `*-plan.md` | Review report |
| 5 | feature-impl | `*-plan.md` | Code + tests + docs |

**File naming conventions:**
- PRDs: `${SPEC_DIR}/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-prd.md`
- Plans: `${SPEC_DIR}/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-plan.md`
- Reviews: Console output or comments in original file

---

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation

### Validation Strategy

Test each skill individually, then test the complete workflow.

### Test 1: feature-define

**Scenario:** Create PRD for a simple feature

**Steps:**
1. Invoke: `/feature-define "Add dark mode toggle to settings"`
2. Verify all phases execute
3. Check PRD has all required sections
4. Validate user stories follow format
5. Validate OKRs are outcome-oriented

**Expected Output:**
- `${SPEC_DIR}/YYYY-MM-DD-dark-mode-prd.md`
- Contains: Background, User Stories, OKRs, UI Design, Risks, Scope
- User stories use "As a [persona], I want [capability], so that [benefit]"
- OKRs describe outcomes, not implementation

### Test 2: feature-plan

**Scenario:** Create development plan from PRD

**Steps:**
1. Use PRD from Test 1
2. Invoke: `/feature-plan ${SPEC_DIR}/YYYY-MM-DD-dark-mode-prd.md`
3. Verify context gathering (reads CLAUDE.md)
4. Check design options presented (2-3 options)
5. Validate task decomposition shows dependencies
6. Verify system OKRs are technical (not product)

**Expected Output:**
- `${SPEC_DIR}/YYYY-MM-DD-dark-mode-plan.md`
- Contains: Requirements, Risk Assessment, Design, Tasks, System OKRs
- Task dependency graph shows waves
- System OKRs focus on performance/quality

### Test 3: feature-impl

**Scenario:** Implement feature from plan

**Steps:**
1. Use plan from Test 2
2. Invoke: `/feature-impl ${SPEC_DIR}/YYYY-MM-DD-dark-mode-plan.md`
3. Verify Phase 0 reads CLAUDE.md
4. Check progress tracking displays at each phase
5. Verify tests written before implementation (TDD)
6. Verify Phase 6 updates documentation

**Expected Output:**
- Working code matching plan
- All tests pass
- Coverage >80%
- CLAUDE.md updated if new patterns introduced
- Progress tracker showed all phases

### Test 4: Review Skills

**Scenario:** Review PRD with issues

**Steps:**
1. Create PRD with intentional issues (vague user stories, implementation-focused OKRs)
2. Invoke: `/feature-define-review ${SPEC_DIR}/YYYY-MM-DD-test-prd.md`
3. Verify issues identified
4. Check feedback is actionable

**Expected Output:**
- Review report with specific issues
- Recommendations for improvement
- Clear approval decision

### Test 5: Complete Workflow

**Scenario:** End-to-end feature development

**Steps:**
1. Invoke: `/feature-workflow`
2. Provide feature idea when prompted
3. Approve PRD at review gate
4. Approve plan at review gate
5. Approve implementation proposal
6. Verify implementation completes

**Expected Output:**
- PRD created in ${SPEC_DIR}
- Plan created in ${SPEC_DIR}
- Working code with tests
- All review gates honored
- Modularity assessment provided

### Test 6: State Detection

**Scenario:** Resume workflow from existing PRD

**Steps:**
1. Create PRD manually or via `/feature-define`
2. Invoke: `/feature-workflow`
3. Verify it detects existing PRD
4. Verify it skips to Phase 3 (Plan Implementation)

**Expected Output:**
- Workflow detects PRD exists
- Skips Phase 1 (Define Requirements)
- Starts from Phase 3 (Plan Implementation)

### Test 7: Parallel vs Sequential

**Scenario:** Workflow decides execution strategy

**Steps:**
1. Create plan with independent tasks
2. Run `/feature-workflow` with that plan
3. Verify it suggests parallel execution

**Expected Output:**
- Workflow analyzes task dependencies
- Identifies parallelization opportunity
- Suggests `/parallel-orchestrate`

---

## Phase 5: Customization

### Adapting to Your Project

The feature development suite uses placeholders that should be customized:

**Environment Variables:**
- `${SPEC_DIR}` - Where PRDs and plans are stored
- `${TOOL_CONFIG}` - AI tool's configuration directory

**Project-Specific Elements:**
- Document naming pattern (YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name or other)
- Approval process (who reviews PRDs/plans?)
- Testing framework (pytest, jest, cargo test, etc.)
- Code conventions (from CLAUDE.md or CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Customization Checklist

```markdown
## Feature Suite Customization

- [ ] Set ${SPEC_DIR} to your specs location
- [ ] Set ${TOOL_CONFIG} to your AI tool's config directory
- [ ] Update document naming pattern in templates
- [ ] Customize review gates (frequency, who approves)
- [ ] Update test commands for your framework
- [ ] Add project-specific risk categories
- [ ] Customize modularity criteria
- [ ] Update progress tracking format if desired
```

### Common Customizations

**1. Review Gate Frequency**

Adjust how often user approval is required:
- **Minimal:** Only approve final implementation
- **Standard:** Approve PRD, plan, implementation proposal
- **Thorough:** Approve each section of PRD and plan

**2. Document Format**

Adapt PRD/plan templates to your organization:
- Add sections for compliance, security, etc.
- Change section order
- Add custom metadata (team, priority, etc.)

**3. Task Decomposition Strategy**

Customize how tasks are broken down:
- Prefer smaller vs. larger tasks
- Different dependency visualization
- Custom complexity ratings

**4. Progress Tracking Style**

Modify the progress tracker appearance:
- Simpler text format
- More/less verbose
- Different symbols or formatting

---

## Phase 6: Best Practices

### Progress Tracking

**Why it matters:**
- Makes Claude report what it's doing (less likely to skip steps)
- Provides audit trail
- User can see current state

**How to use:**
- ALL workflow skills (feature-workflow, feature-impl) include progress tracking
- Progress updates after each phase completion
- Shows current task and checklist items

**Example from feature-impl:**
```
PHASES:
✅ Phase 0: Read documentation
🔄 Phase 1: Research existing code [IN PROGRESS] ◀── YOU ARE HERE
⏸️ Phase 2: Design structure

CURRENT TASK:
Phase 1: Researching similar features and patterns
Status: Found 3 similar implementations to review
Started: [TIME]

CHECKLIST:
✅ Search for similar features
🔲 Review existing patterns
```

### Documentation Maintenance

**Why it matters:**
- Prevents convention drift
- Prevents code duplication
- Ensures patterns are followed

**How to use:**
- Phase 0: Read CLAUDE.md and project conventions
- Final Phase: Update CLAUDE.md if new patterns introduced
- Check for drift: Did implementation follow conventions?

**Required in:**
- `feature-impl` (reads Phase 0, updates Final Phase)
- Any implementation skill

### Review Gates

**Purpose:**
- User alignment before proceeding
- Catch issues early
- Prevent wasted implementation effort

**When to use:**
- After PRD creation (ensure requirements correct)
- After plan creation (validate technical approach)
- Before implementation (approve design)

**Optional, not mandatory:**
- Users can skip gates if they trust the output
- Review skills provide structured feedback when needed

### State Detection

**Purpose:**
- Resume from any point in workflow
- Don't duplicate work
- Support iterative development

**How it works:**
- Check for existing PRD → skip to planning
- Check for existing plan → skip to implementation
- Check for partial code → resume from last task

**Implemented in:**
- `feature-workflow` Phase 0

### TDD Workflow

**Purpose:**
- Catch bugs early
- Design better interfaces
- Refactor with confidence

**Process:**
1. Write tests first (Phase 3)
2. Verify tests fail
3. Implement to pass tests (Phase 4)
4. Verify tests pass (Phase 5)
5. Refactor with confidence

**Required in:**
- `feature-impl`

## Summary

### Skills Created

After following this guide, you will have:

- `${TOOL_CONFIG}/skills/feature-workflow/SKILL.md` - Orchestrator
- `${TOOL_CONFIG}/skills/feature-define/SKILL.md` - PRD creation
- `${TOOL_CONFIG}/skills/feature-define-review/SKILL.md` - PRD validation
- `${TOOL_CONFIG}/skills/feature-plan/SKILL.md` - Development planning
- `${TOOL_CONFIG}/skills/feature-plan-review/SKILL.md` - Plan validation
- `${TOOL_CONFIG}/skills/feature-impl/SKILL.md` - TDD implementation

### Key Capabilities

**Requirements Definition:**
- Lightweight PRDs with user stories and OKRs
- Background, UI design, risks, scope boundaries
- Review validation for completeness

**Development Planning:**
- Question resolution before design
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Multiple design options with trade-offs
- Task decomposition with dependency graphs
- System-level OKRs for technical success

**Implementation:**
- TDD workflow (tests before code)
- Documentation maintenance (read Phase 0, update Final Phase)
- Progress tracking throughout
- Convention following

**Orchestration:**
- State detection (resume from any point)
- Review gates (user alignment)
- Parallel vs. sequential decision
- Modularity evaluation

### Workflow Patterns

**Complete Feature Workflow:**
```
Feature Idea
  → feature-define → PRD
    → Review gate
      → feature-plan → Development plan
        → Review gate
          → feature-impl → Working code + tests
            → Modularity review
              → Complete feature
```

**State-Based Resume:**
```
PRD exists → Skip to planning
Plan exists → Skip to implementation
Code exists → Resume from last task
```

**Parallel Execution:**
```
Independent tasks detected
  → Switch to parallel-orchestrate
    → Multiple sessions work in parallel
      → Integration when complete
```

### Next Steps

1. **Create skills** using templates in this guide
2. **Test individually** using validation scenarios
3. **Test complete workflow** end-to-end
4. **Customize** for your project conventions
5. **Document** any project-specific adaptations

### Decision Tree

```
Do you have a feature idea?
├─ YES → Start with /feature-workflow or /feature-define
└─ NO → Define the problem first

Do you have a PRD?
├─ YES → Use /feature-plan or /feature-workflow
└─ NO → Use /feature-define

Do you have a development plan?
├─ YES → Use /feature-impl or /feature-workflow
└─ NO → Use /feature-plan

Do tasks have dependencies?
├─ YES → Use /feature-impl (sequential)
└─ NO → Consider /parallel-orchestrate

Do you need structured feedback?
├─ YES → Use review skills
└─ NO → Simple approval at gates is fine
```
