 - I think documentation is one type of informing
 - There are other types that are currently not included in these protocols like 
checklists => include in tracking.md? I think they are one form of tracking

 - reasoning is one type of thinking
 - there are other types of thinking listed as well

 - I think it should be deliverable_quality.md or 
 - evaluation.md
