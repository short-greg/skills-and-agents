## Goal

Enable effective communication by matching delivery style to intent and audience.

---

## Intent

What you say matters, but how you say it determines whether it lands. Recommendations can feel like commands; suggestions can feel dismissive; hedging can undermine confidence. This protocol provides techniques for calibrating delivery to achieve intended effect.

---

## Scope

Techniques for suggesting, recommending, hedging, framing, and presenting options. Applies to any communication where tone and phrasing affect reception. Does not cover content selection (what to say) — only delivery (how to say it).

## Artifacts and Outputs

| Artifact/Output | Purpose | When to Use | Artifact? |
|-----------------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Framed Message** | Message shaped for specific pragmatic effect | When delivery must match intent precisely | Output |
| **Option Set** | Structured presentation of choices with framing | When presenting alternatives for decision | Output |
| **Confidence Statement** | Explicit statement of certainty level with rationale | When uncertainty must be communicated clearly | Output |
| **Hedge Expression** | Qualified statement that signals appropriate uncertainty | When avoiding over-commitment or acknowledging limits | Output |

---

## Core Approaches

### Directness Calibration

Use directness techniques to match communication force to situation requirements.

| Technique | When | Why | How | Output/Artifact | Positive Validation | Negative Validation |
|-----------|------|-----|-----|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Direct Assertion** | High stakes, clear authority, or explicit request for directness | To communicate unambiguously and efficiently | Use imperative mood, state conclusion first, eliminate hedging words, be explicit about expectations | Framed Message | Is meaning unambiguous? Is action clear? | Could the statement be misunderstood? Is it softer than intended? |
| **Indirect Suggestion** | Relationship preservation matters, hierarchy is sensitive, or face-saving is needed | To influence without commanding | Use question form ("Have you considered...?"), present as observation, offer rather than instruct, use conditional language | Framed Message | Is suggestion clear despite indirection? Is face preserved? | Is it so indirect the point is lost? Does it seem passive-aggressive? |
| **Graduated Directness** | Recipient's receptiveness is unknown | To calibrate force based on response | Start with softest form that could succeed, observe reception, increase directness if needed, match escalation to resistance | — | Is escalation path planned? Are you reading reception signals? | Are you starting too soft or too strong? |
| **Context-Matched Force** | Different audiences or situations require different force | To match directness to context norms | Assess relationship (peer, subordinate, superior), assess culture (direct vs. indirect), assess stakes (high vs. low), adjust force accordingly | Framed Message | Does force match context? Would audience expect this level? | Is directness mismatched to relationship or culture? |

### Option Presentation

Use option techniques to structure choices for clear decision-making.

| Technique | When | Why | How | Output/Artifact | Positive Validation | Negative Validation |
|-----------|------|-----|-----|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Balanced Options** | Decision should be made by recipient without undue influence | To present choices fairly and completely | Present 2-4 options, describe each with same depth, note pros/cons for each, avoid loading language | Option Set | Are options presented with equal treatment? Is choice genuinely open? | Is one option obviously favored? Are some options dismissed? |
| **Recommended Option** | Expertise warrants guidance, recipient requests recommendation | To guide toward best choice while preserving autonomy | Present options, state recommendation explicitly, explain reasoning for recommendation, acknowledge tradeoffs | Option Set | Is recommendation explicit? Is reasoning clear? Can recipient still choose differently? | Is recommendation buried? Is reasoning missing? |
| **Ordered Options** | Some options are objectively better by stated criteria | To structure choices by priority without dictating | Define ordering criterion, present best-fit first, explain why each is ordered as shown, make ordering logic transparent | Option Set | Is ordering criterion explicit? Is logic for order clear? | Is ordering arbitrary or unexplained? |
| **Default with Alternatives** | One option is standard, others are edge cases | To simplify decision while preserving optionality | Present default prominently, note when alternatives apply, make opting out easy, explain what makes default appropriate | Option Set | Is default clearly marked? Are conditions for alternatives clear? | Is default imposed rather than suggested? Are alternatives hidden? |

### Confidence Signaling

Use confidence techniques to communicate certainty level accurately.

| Technique | When | Why | How | Output/Artifact | Positive Validation | Negative Validation |
|-----------|------|-----|-----|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Explicit Confidence** | Uncertainty level is decision-relevant | To state certainty directly rather than imply it | Use percentage or qualitative scale, state basis for confidence level, distinguish evidence-based from intuition-based, update if confidence changes | Confidence Statement | Is confidence level explicit? Is basis stated? | Is confidence implied rather than stated? Is basis missing? |
| **Epistemic Hedging** | Knowledge is incomplete or uncertain | To qualify statements appropriately without undermining them | Use modal verbs (may, might, could), use hedging adverbs (probably, likely, possibly), use introductory phrases ("It appears that..."), match hedge strength to uncertainty level | Hedge Expression | Does hedge match actual uncertainty? Is meaning still clear? | Is hedging excessive (undermining credibility)? Is hedging absent when uncertainty exists? |
| **Source Attribution** | Basis for claim affects how it should be weighted | To distinguish between types of knowledge | Distinguish observation vs. inference vs. assumption, cite sources when available, flag when relying on memory or estimation, note recency of information | Confidence Statement | Are sources of knowledge explicit? Can recipient assess reliability? | Are claims presented as fact without basis? |
| **Uncertainty Boundaries** | Some aspects are certain, others uncertain | To be precise about what is and isn't known | State what is known with confidence, state what is uncertain, state what is unknown, distinguish "I don't know" from "unknowable" | Confidence Statement | Are certainty boundaries explicit? Is uncertainty localized? | Is everything presented with same confidence level? |

### Framing Techniques

Use framing techniques to shape how information is perceived.

| Technique | When | Why | How | Output/Artifact | Positive Validation | Negative Validation |
|-----------|------|-----|-----|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Gain vs. Loss Framing** | Motivation matters for reception | To frame outcomes in terms that resonate with audience | For risk-averse audiences, frame as avoiding loss; for opportunity-seeking, frame as potential gain; match frame to audience motivation | Framed Message | Does frame match audience motivation? Is framing transparent? | Is framing manipulative rather than clarifying? |
| **Positive Reframing** | Message is inherently negative but needs constructive reception | To present challenges in terms that enable action | Focus on what can be done (not just what's wrong), highlight learning opportunity, identify path forward, acknowledge difficulty while emphasizing agency | Framed Message | Is there a path forward? Is difficulty acknowledged? | Is positivity false or dismissive of real problems? |
| **Neutral Framing** | Objectivity is paramount, bias must be avoided | To present information without loading it | Use neutral descriptors, present facts before interpretation, avoid emotional language, let recipient draw conclusions | Framed Message | Is language neutral? Are facts separated from interpretation? | Is framing subtly biased despite intent? |
| **Contrast Framing** | Relative position matters more than absolute | To establish reference points for evaluation | State baseline or comparison point, position current state relative to baseline, make contrast explicit, choose appropriate comparisons | Framed Message | Is comparison point clear? Is contrast fair? | Is comparison misleading or cherry-picked? |

## Example Patterns

Structured example sequences for pragmatic communication in different contexts. Far more are possible.

### Delivering Recommendations

Use when providing guidance that should influence but not dictate.

1. Assess relationship and context (Context-Matched Force)
2. Determine appropriate directness level
3. State recommendation with matched force
4. Provide reasoning using explicit confidence levels (Explicit Confidence)
5. Acknowledge alternatives exist (Balanced Options or Recommended Option)
6. Hedge appropriately where uncertainty exists (Epistemic Hedging)
7. Frame to match audience motivation (Gain vs. Loss Framing)

**Exit Conditions:**
- Recipient requests more directness → increase force, reduce hedging
- Recipient pushes back → switch to Balanced Options, reduce advocacy
- Uncertainty is too high to recommend → switch to presenting options without recommendation

### Presenting Options with Framing

Use when facilitating decisions with multiple valid paths.

1. Identify decision to be made and stakeholder
2. Generate 2-4 genuine options (not strawmen)
3. Choose presentation strategy (Balanced, Recommended, Ordered, or Default)
4. Apply appropriate framing (Gain/Loss, Positive, Neutral, or Contrast)
5. Signal confidence in each option's assessment (Explicit Confidence)
6. Present with matched directness (Context-Matched Force)
7. Make decision process clear (what happens next)

**Exit Conditions:**
- Options are not genuinely distinct → consolidate before presenting
- Stakeholder lacks context to decide → provide context first, defer decision
- One option is clearly wrong → remove it or explain why it's included
