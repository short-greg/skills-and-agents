# Goal Setting

Systematic techniques for establishing clear, directional objectives.

Establish goals that define what to achieve and why it matters.

---

## Goal

Establish clear objectives that provide direction, focus effort, and enable meaningful progress.

---

## Intent

Without well-formed goals, work lacks direction. Activity-oriented goals track busywork rather than value. Goals that are too vague fail to guide decisions; goals that are too narrow miss the bigger picture. This protocol ensures objectives are outcome-focused, appropriately scoped, and aligned with larger purpose.

---

## Scope

Techniques for discovering what goals to pursue, formulating goals as outcomes rather than activities, decomposing goals into sub-goals and milestones, aligning goals within hierarchies, and prioritizing between competing goals. Criteria_setting handles making goals measurable and verifiable.

## Core Approaches

### Goal Discovery

Use discovery techniques to identify what goals to pursue before formulating them.

| Technique | When | Why | How | Positive Validation | Negative Validation |
|-----------|------|-----|-----|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Stakeholder Analysis** | Goals must serve someone's needs | To ensure goals address real needs | Identify who is affected, determine what each stakeholder values, find common ground, prioritize by impact | Are key stakeholders identified? Are their needs understood? | Are you assuming needs without checking? |
| **Problem/Opportunity Framing** | Starting point is unclear | To ground goals in concrete problems or opportunities | Identify current pain points or gaps, articulate what's wrong or missing, determine root cause vs symptom, frame as opportunity to address | Is the problem concrete? Is root cause identified? | Are you solving symptoms rather than causes? |
| **Ideal State Visualization** | Need to clarify desired end state | To define success before defining path | Describe what success looks like, identify key differences from current state, determine what changes are essential vs nice-to-have | Is ideal state concrete? Are essential changes identified? | Is ideal state too vague or unrealistic? |
| **Inversion** | Positive framing yields vague goals | To clarify goals through negative space | Ask "What would failure look like?", identify what must be avoided, convert avoidances into positive objectives | Are failure modes identified? Do objectives address them? | Are you only avoiding negatives without pursuing positives? |

### Goal Formulation

Use formulation techniques to express goals correctly as outcomes, not activities.

| Technique | When | Why | How | Positive Validation | Negative Validation |
|-----------|------|-----|-----|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Outcome Focus** | Goal describes activity rather than result | To ensure goals track value delivered, not work done | Identify what changes when goal is achieved, express as state change or result, ask "So what?" to find underlying outcome | Does goal describe a result? Does achieving it deliver value? | Does goal describe an activity (verb) rather than outcome (state)? |
| **Scope Calibration** | Goal is too broad or too narrow | To set appropriate level of ambition | Ask "Why?" to go broader (purpose), ask "How?" to go narrower (action), find level where goal is actionable but meaningful | Is goal actionable? Is it meaningful? | Is goal so broad it's paralyzing? So narrow it's trivial? |
| **Directional Framing** | Goal needs to inspire and guide | To make goals motivating and directional | Express aspiration not just target, include why it matters, make it memorable and communicable | Is goal inspiring? Does it provide direction? | Is goal purely mechanical with no motivational pull? |
| **Boundary Setting** | Goal scope is ambiguous | To clarify what's included and excluded | Define what's in scope, define what's explicitly out of scope, identify dependencies on other goals, document constraints | Are boundaries explicit? Are exclusions clear? | Could scope creep occur due to ambiguity? |

### Goal Structuring

Use structuring techniques to organize, decompose, and prioritize goals.

| Technique | When | Why | How | Positive Validation | Negative Validation |
|-----------|------|-----|-----|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Goal Decomposition** | Goal is too large to pursue directly | To create actionable sub-goals and milestones | Break into independent sub-goals, test each: "Could I do this right now?", sequence into milestones, ensure sub-goals collectively achieve parent | Are sub-goals independent? Do they sum to parent goal? | Are sub-goals coupled or overlapping? |
| **Hierarchy Alignment** | Goal exists within larger context | To ensure goal contributes to higher-level objectives | Identify parent goals this serves, verify contribution is real, check for conflicts with sibling goals, cascade from strategic to tactical | Does goal serve parent objectives? Are conflicts resolved? | Is goal orphaned or misaligned with strategy? |
| **Priority Setting** | Multiple goals compete for resources | To determine which goals take precedence | Assess impact vs effort for each, identify dependencies between goals, determine sequencing constraints, rank by value delivered | Are priorities explicit? Is ranking justified? | Are all goals "high priority" (meaning none are)? |
| **Tradeoff Analysis** | Goals conflict with each other | To make explicit choices between competing goals | Identify conflicting goals, determine which to optimize vs satisfice, document tradeoff decision and rationale | Are tradeoffs explicit? Is rationale documented? | Are conflicts ignored or deferred indefinitely? |

## Example Patterns

Structured example sequences for goal setting in different contexts. Far more are possible.

### Establishing Project Goals

Use when starting a new project or initiative.

1. Identify stakeholders and their needs (Stakeholder Analysis)
2. Frame the core problem or opportunity (Problem/Opportunity Framing)
3. Visualize the ideal end state (Ideal State Visualization)
4. Express goals as outcomes, not activities (Outcome Focus)
5. Calibrate scope - neither too broad nor narrow (Scope Calibration)
6. Decompose into milestones if goal is large (Goal Decomposition)
7. Align with organizational objectives (Hierarchy Alignment)
8. Hand off to criteria_setting for measurable key results

**Exit Conditions:**
- Cannot identify stakeholders → stop, clarify who this serves
- Problem is symptom not root cause → stop, dig deeper with "5 Whys"
- Goals describe activities not outcomes → stop, ask "So what?" until reaching outcome

### Breaking Down a Large Goal

Use when a goal is too large to pursue directly.

1. Test: "Could I start working on this right now?"
2. If no, identify major components or phases
3. For each component, apply outcome focus (what result, not what activity)
4. Test each sub-goal for independence (can pursue without others)
5. Sequence sub-goals into milestones with dependencies
6. Verify sub-goals collectively achieve parent goal
7. Prioritize sub-goals by value and dependencies

**Exit Conditions:**
- Sub-goals are coupled → stop, reframe to create independence
- Sub-goals don't sum to parent → stop, identify missing pieces
- Still can't start → stop, decompose further
